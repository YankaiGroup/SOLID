abstract: "We argue that stochastic programming provides a powerful framework to tune and analyze the performance limits of controllers. In particular, stochastic programming formulations can be used to identify controller settings that remain robust across diverse scenarios (disturbances, set-points, and modeling errors) observed in real-time operations. We also discuss how to use historical data and sampling techniques to construct operational scenarios and inference analysis techniques to provide statistical guarantees on limiting controller performance. Under the proposed framework, it is also possible to use risk metrics to handle extreme (rare) events and stochastic dominance concepts to conduct systematic benchmarking studies. We provide numerical studies to illustrate the concepts and to demonstrate that modern modeling and local/global optimization tools can tackle large-scale applications. The proposed work also opens the door to data-based controller tuning strategies that can be implemented in real-time operations. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 2997–3010, 2018"
