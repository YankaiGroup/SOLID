abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework to optimize the specificity and speed of liquid crystal (LC)-based chemical sensors. Specifically, we demonstrate that ML techniques can uncover valuable feature information from surface-driven LC orientational transitions triggered by gas-phase analytes. We design an experimental LC system with optical response to a stream of nitrogen containing either DMMP or 30% relative humidity. Our framework enables automatic classification and achieves sensing accuracies of over 99%.
