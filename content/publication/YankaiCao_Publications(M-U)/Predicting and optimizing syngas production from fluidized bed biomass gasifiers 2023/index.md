abstract: Biomass gasification is one of the primary thermal conversion processes. We apply machine learning (RF, SVM, ANN) to predict syngas composition and lower heating values using various lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks. Models achieve high prediction accuracy with R2 and RMSE results across multiple techniques.
