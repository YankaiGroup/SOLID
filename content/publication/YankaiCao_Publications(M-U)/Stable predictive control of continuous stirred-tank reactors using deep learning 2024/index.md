abstract: "In this work, a Lyapunov-based predictive control method utilizing deep learning techniques is proposed for driving continuous-time nonlinear processes towards the desired equilibrium point. Initially, a neural ordinary differential equation model is developed to learn the continuous-time dynamics from discrete-time sampling data. Subsequently, the theoretical conditions that the control Lyapunov function (CLF) developed on the learned continuous-time system is feasible to act on the actual system through a zero-order-holder are analyzed. Building upon the theoretical analysis and the constructed continuous-time dynamics, a deep neural network control Lyapunov function (DNN-CLF) controller is developed. Importantly, the DNN-CLF is independent of the affine system formulation, effectively addressing the challenge of designing the CLF. Benefiting from the stability guarantee provided by the established DNN-CLF, it is integrated into the model predictive control (MPC) framework to develop Lyapunov-based MPC to further improve the control performance. To ensure safety, considering error propagation and associated risks with enlarging the feasible region of the CLF, tubes are constructed and integrated into the MPC scheme. Finally, a numerical simulation of a chemical process is conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed method."
