abstract: "Soil amendment has recently been addressed as one of the promising applications of torrefied biomass, where the distribution of nutrients is a significant parameter of interest. The present study uses an x-ray fluorescence technique to elucidate the influence of torrefaction severity on the nutrient composition of biomass (e.g. rice husk). An increase in the extent of process severity leads to an enhancement in the fixed carbon content. Hence, the variation in nutrient composition is analyzed with respect to changes in the fixed carbon content. Results reflected that variation of nutrients with increasing fixed carbon content does not follow a uniform trend. It signifies the need for understanding the effect of process conditions, chemical forms, and interactions among the elements on the release of compounds containing nutrients. Enrichment of P, Fe, Mn and Zn, and reduction of K, Ca, S, Cl, Cu, Ni, Si, Sr, Ti, and Br have been observed in the solid product obtained after torrefaction. Concentration of Si followed K and P are maximum in all samples. K, Cl, S, and Br loss occurs significantly because of relatively lower stability in the torrefaction temperature range. The present findings would be helpful in selecting the conditions required to produce torrefied biomass to amend a specific soil type for a particular crop."
