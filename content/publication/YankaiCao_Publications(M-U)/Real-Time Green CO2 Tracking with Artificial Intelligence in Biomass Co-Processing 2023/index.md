abstract: "This study presents an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodology for real-time green CO2emission tracking in biomass co-processing at oil refineries. This approach aims to reduce carbon intensity fuels and minimize environmental impact. The methodology includes data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model selection, training, and validation. Various models like neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees are evaluated considering process variables. The AI-driven system successfully analyzes green CO2 emissions in real-time, aiding in identifying trends, detecting anomalies, and optimizing processing conditions to reduce emissions while maintaining efficiency and product quality. This breakthrough approach provides significant potential in promoting more sustainable practices within the industry. Future work will focus on enhancing AI models and exploring their broader applications in biomass co-processing."
