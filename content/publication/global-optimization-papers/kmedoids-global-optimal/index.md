abstract: We study the deterministic global optimization of the K-Medoids clustering problem. This work proposes a branch and bound (BB) scheme using a tailored Lagrangian relaxation method to provide a lower bound at each BB node. The method guarantees maximum gap closure analytically, supports parallel computation, and achieves provable global optimality. We also present bound tightening techniques. Extensive experiments show our method achieves a 0.1% optimality gap within 4 hours on datasets with up to one million samples.
