abstract: This paper proposes a global optimization algorithm for the k-center clustering problem using a reduced-space branch and bound scheme. It guarantees convergence by only branching on the cluster centers. On a dataset with 14 million samples, it achieves 0.1% optimality within 2 hours, improving objective value by 30.4% over heuristics.
