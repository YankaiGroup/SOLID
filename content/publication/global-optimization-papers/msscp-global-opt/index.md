abstract: We formulate the minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem (MSSCP) as a two-stage optimization and propose a branch and bound algorithm. By bounding on cluster centers and parallelizing bound computation, our method solves problems with up to 200,000 samples and outperforms classical global solvers on synthetic and real datasets.
