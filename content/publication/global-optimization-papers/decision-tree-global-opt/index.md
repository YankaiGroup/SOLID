abstract: This paper proposes a reduced-space branch and bound algorithm for optimal decision tree training using mixed-integer programming. It enables scalable parallelized bounding and novel sample reduction. Tested on 21 datasets, the method finds global optima on large datasets with over 245,000 samples and improves average training accuracy by 3.6% and testing accuracy by 2.8% over the state-of-the-art.
