abstract: "Flare systems are used as safety (relief) devices to manage abnormal situations in infrastructure systems (natural gas and oil processing plants, andpipelines), manufacturing facilities (chemical plants, offshore rings), and power generation facilities. Flare design is influenced by several uncertain factors such as the amountand composition of the waste stream and the ambient conditions.Here, we propose to use a chance-constrained nonlinear programming (CC-NLP) formulation to find designs that minimize cost and that mitigate the risk that the combustion radiation exceeds a certain safety threshold.
CCs are a powerful modeling paradigm that helps decision-makers control risk. Unfortunately, CCs cannot be handled directly by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. CCs can reformulated into a standard NLP when the quantile function of the constraint can be expressed in algebraic form. This property has been exploited extensively in the special case in which the constraint mapping is linear in both arguments and the random data vector is Gaussian [1]. Under these assumptions, the constraint mapping is Gaussian and its quantile can be expressed as a weighted sum of its two moments (the expectation and the variance). For more general settings it is possible to deriveexact reformulations using integer variables, as originally proposed in [3]. Unfortunately, in the context of CC-NLP, integer reformulations would lead to large-scale and nonconvex MINLPs.
We review different strategies to tackle large-scale CC-NLPs arising in flare system design. In particular, we consider the special case in which the algebraic structure of the moments and of the quantile function of the constraint mapping is known or approximately known and propose to use moment matching (MM) to compute its parameters and to derive its quantile function. We argue that this procedure can be applied to a wide range of distributions that go beyond Gaussian such as uniform, log-normal, and generalized extreme value (Weibull, Frechet, Gumbel). The reason is that many random phenomena observed in science and engineering can be explained using asymptotic results such as the central limit and the extreme value (Fisher-Tippett) theorem or because basic transformations and fundamental relationships between distributions can be exploited. While this approach cannot be applied to general settings, we believe that there is value in studying the structure of the problem at hand to explore if suitable algebraic approximations emerge. To handle more general settings, we consider the use of a recently proposed sigmoidal approximation approach (SigVaR), which can be used to solve large-scale NLPs with chance constraints by using powerful serial and parallel solvers such as Ipopt and PIPS-NLP [2, 4]. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing conservative approximations such as the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) approximation that not offer a mechanism to enforce convergence to a solution of CC-P, and as the almost-surely (AS) approximation which enforces the constraint constraint with probability one (almost surely). This is equivalent to enforce the constraint for all possible realizations of the uncertainty. Our flare design study confirms that MM and SigVaR provide nearly exact solutions of the CC-NLP while AS and CVaR solutions exhibit extreme conservatism."
