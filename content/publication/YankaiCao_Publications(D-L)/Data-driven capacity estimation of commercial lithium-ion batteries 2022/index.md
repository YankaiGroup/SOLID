abstract: Accurate capacity estimation is crucial for the reliable and safe operation of lithium-ion batteries. In particular, exploiting the relaxation voltage curve features could enable battery capacity estimation without additional cycling information. Here, we report the study of three datasets comprising 130 commercial lithium-ion cells cycled under various conditions to evaluate the capacity estimation approach. One dataset is collected for model building from batteries with LiNi0.6Co0.2Al0.2O2-based positive electrodes. The other two datasets, used for validation, are obtained from batteries with LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2-based positive electrodes and batteries with the blend of LiNiCoMnO2 + LiNiCoAlO2 positive electrodes. Base models that use machine learning methods are employed to estimate the battery capacity using features derived from the relaxation voltage profiles.
