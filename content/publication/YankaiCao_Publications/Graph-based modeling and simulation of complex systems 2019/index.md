abstract: We present graph-based modeling abstractions for cyber-physical dependencies. We propose algebraic and communication graph abstractions, which are implemented in the Julia-based software package Plasmo.jl. These abstractions support optimization and simulation in distributed, centralized, and hierarchical computing architectures.
