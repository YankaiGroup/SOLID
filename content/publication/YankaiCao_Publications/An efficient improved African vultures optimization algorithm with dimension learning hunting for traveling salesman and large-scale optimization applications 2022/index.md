abstract: "Exploring the finest shortest-path traveling salesman optimization application is a typical NP-hard problem. Similarly, the solution of large-scale optimization applications is also a challenging issue in front of scientists. This study offers a newly modified dimension learning hunting (DLH)-based AVOA called DLHAV algorithm to resolve highly complex continuous and discrete applications. It helps improve the imbalance amid the hunting (or exploitation) and search (or exploration), the lack of crowd diversity, slow convergence speed, trapping in local optima, and early convergence of solutions."
