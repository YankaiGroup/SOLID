abstract: We address optimization of large-scale, nonlinear, block-structured problems with a significant number of coupling variables. A Schur-complement-based implicit solver is developed for solving the block-structured linear systems arising in interior-point methods, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding explicit formation and factorization of the Schur-complement.
