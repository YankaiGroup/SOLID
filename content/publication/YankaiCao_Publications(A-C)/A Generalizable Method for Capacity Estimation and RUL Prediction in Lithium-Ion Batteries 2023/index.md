abstract: "Data-driven methods have attracted much attention in capacity estimation and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of Lithium-ion batteries. However, existing studies
rely on complex machine learning models (e.g., Gaussian Process Regression, Neural
Networks, etc) that are applicable to specific observed operating conditions, and the
prediction accuracy can be affected by different usage scenarios. This paper proposes to
adopt a linear and robust machine learning technique, partial least squares regression,
for battery capacity estimation and RUL prediction based on the partial incremental
capacity curve. The features can be easily obtained by interpolation of the measured"
