abstract: "The integration of renewable energy generating units, often located in remote regions with limited grid connectivity, has created a pressing need for coordinated generation and transmission expansion planning (G&TEP). However, considering full AC network representation, the co-optimization of generation and transmission poses a challenging nonconvex mixed-integer problem that is prone to locally suboptimal solutions. In this study, we propose a tailored global optimization framework to identify the most cost-effective set of generating units and candidate transmission lines while satisfying operational and investment constraints. The proposed solver employs second-order cone relaxation, further enhanced through a set of relaxation-tightening constraints, along with feasibility-based and optimization-based bound tightening techniques to improve relaxation strength. A salient feature of the solver is the integration of a no-good cut technique, which enables efficient exploration of alternative candidate solutions within the feasible region. As demonstrated by numerical results, this technique is specifically tailored to the G&TEP problem and significantly improves solution quality while reducing the runtime required to achieve global optimality. A comparative performance analysis with state-of-the-art global MINLP solvers demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves tighter optimality gaps faster and exhibits superior flexibility and scalability."
