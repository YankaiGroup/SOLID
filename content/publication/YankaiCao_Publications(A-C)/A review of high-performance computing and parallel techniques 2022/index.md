abstract: "The accelerating technological landscape and drive towards net-zero emission made the power system grow in scale and complexity. Serial computational approaches for grid planning and operation struggle to execute necessary calculations within reasonable times. Resorting to high-performance and parallel computing approaches has become paramount. Moreover, the ambitious plans for the future grid and IoT integration make a shift towards utilizing Cloud computing inevitable. This article recounts the dawn of parallel computation and its appearance in power system studies, reviewing the most recent literature and research on exploiting the available computational resources and technologies today. The article starts with a brief introduction to the field. The relevant hardware and paradigms are then explained thoroughly in this article providing a base for the reader to understand the literature. Later, parallel power system studies are reviewed, reciting the study development from older papers up to the 21st century, emphasizing the most impactful work of the last decade. The studies included system stability studies, state estimation and power system operation, and market optimization. The reviews are split into \ac{CPU} based,\ac{GPU} based, and Cloud-based studies. Finally, the state-of-the-art is discussed, highlighting the issue of standardization and the future of computation in power system studies."
