abstract: "Rapid and accurate identification of Arcobacter is of great importance because it is considered an emerging food- and waterborne pathogen and potential zoonotic agent. Raman spectroscopy can differentiate bacteria based on Raman scattering spectral patterns of whole cells in a fast, reagentless, and easy-to-use manner. We aimed to detect and discriminate Arcobacter bacteria at the species level using confocal micro
Raman spectroscopy (785nm) coupled with neural networks. A total of 82 reference and field isolates of 18 Arcobacter species from clinical, environmental, and agri-food sources were included. We determined that the bacterial cultivation time and growth temperature did not significantly influence the Raman spectral reproducibility and discrimination capability. The genus Arcobacter could be successfully differentiated from the closely related genera Campylobacter and Helicobacter using principal-component analysis. For the identification of Arcobacter to the species level, an accuracy of 97.2% was achieved for all 18 Arcobacter species using Raman spectroscopy combined with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The predictive capability of Raman-CNN was further validated using an independent data set of 12 Arcobacter strains. Furthermore, a Raman spectroscopy based fully connected artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed to determine the actual ratio of a specific Arcobacter species in a bacterial mixture ranging from 5% to 100% by biomass (regression coefficient 0.99). The application of both CNN and fully connected ANN improved the accuracy of Raman spectroscopy for bacterial species determination compared to the conventional chemometrics. This newly developed approach enables rapid identification and species determinationof Arcobacter within an hour following cultivation."
