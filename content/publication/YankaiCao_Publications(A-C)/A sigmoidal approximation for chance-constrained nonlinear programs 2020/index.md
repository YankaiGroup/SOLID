abstract: We propose a sigmoidal approximation for value-at-risk (SigVaR) in nonlinear programming problems with chance constraints. The method is conservative, scalable, and can be formulated as a standard NLP. The approach connects CVaR with SigVaR, providing tractable approximations and good initializations for large-scale problems.
