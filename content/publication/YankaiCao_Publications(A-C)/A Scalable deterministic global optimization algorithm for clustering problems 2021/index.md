abstract: "This paper proposes a two-stage global optimization algorithm for the minimum sum-of-squares clustering task. A reduced-space branch and bound algorithm is used, with bounds constructed through scenario grouping and Lagrangian decomposition. It achieves high scalability with parallel execution."
