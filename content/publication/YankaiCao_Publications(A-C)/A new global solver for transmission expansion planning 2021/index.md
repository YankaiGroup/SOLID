abstract: "To design a reliable and secure power system, it is necessary to have enough transmission capacity. The solution of transmission expansion planning (TEP) problem determines cost-optimal investment in future transmission equipment. In this paper, we propose a new global solver, named Global-TEP, for the TEP problem with an AC network representation (ACTEP), which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. The proposed solver is based on second-order cone relaxation, enhanced relaxation tightening constraints, and optimization-based/feasibility-based bound tightening techniques. Multiple enhanced relaxation tightening constraints are incorporated into the mixed-integer second-order cone relaxation of TEP in order to obtain a very strong relaxation as the lower bounding problem. In addition, a novel feasibility-based bound tightening technique is proposed to tighten the bounds of decision variables in a considerably short runtime. Finally, introducing a novel application of optimization-based bound tightening technique, Global-TEP is constructed that can solve the ACTEP problem efficiently with a guaranteed optimality gap. As illustrated by numerical case studies, Global-TEP is more scalable, more flexible, and much faster than the available global solvers."
