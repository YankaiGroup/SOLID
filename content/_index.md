            <p class="text-2xl font-bold" style="font-family:Times New Roman, sans-serif;">Our research group focuses on the design and implementation of large-scale local and global optimization algorithms to solve problems that arise in diverse 
            decision-making paradigms such as machine learning, data analysis, and estimation as well as stochastic optimization, optimal control, and complex networks. Our 
            algorithms combine mathematical techniques and emerging high-performance computing hardware (e.g., multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and computing clusters) to achieve 
            computational scalability. The goal is to make these developments accessible to academic and industrial users by implementing algorithms on easy-to-use and 
            extensible software libraries.</p> <br>
            <p class="text-2xl font-bold" style="font-family:Times New Roman, sans-serif;">Furthermore, We have applied the algorithms and tools to help collaborators address engineering and scientific questions that arise in diverse application 
            domainsincluding conflict resolution in energy system design, robust control of crystallization systems, predictive control of wind turbines, power management in 
            large networks, estimation of microbial growth models, and image classification for contaminant detection. </p>
